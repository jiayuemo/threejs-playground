<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Credit and Workflow</h2>
This project is an extension of the ThreeJS in practice tutorial by @Domenico_brz.

- [His Personal Website] (https://domenicobrz.github.io/webgl/)
- [Youtube Tutorial Series] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsCYEA_UuZA)

At the conclusion of the series, the procedural map was generated with threeJS in vanillaJS.

Additional work beyond the tutorial includes:
- addition of scene prop, or doodle, to the procedure map. Try to find the snowmen like statues sitting on top of snow tiles on the map! â›„
- fine tuning of cloud count and cloud height â›…
- More expressive, commented, consistent function naming to clarify aspects of working with ThreeJS 
- Modularized source code from monolith main file ðŸ”§
- Integration with VITE frontend toolkit for improvements in Developer Experience ðŸŒŸ
- Integration with typescript to deepen understanding of ThreeJS concepts 

<h2>Build Tools and Frameworks</h2>
This project was bootstrapped with the VITE [quickstart tool] (https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

This is a vanillaJS project with typescript.

<h2>Packages</h2>

- [three] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/three), as a general purpose 3D library 
- [three-stdlib] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-stdlib), threeJS utility functions
- [simplex-noise] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplex-noise), noise gradient for procedural goodness

<h2>Local development</h2>
